In this project, the sound dataset collected has some of the indoor areas noisier than the other indoor areas. It would be interesting to predict the area where 
the audio was recorded for the future scope of deciding if it is a noisy indoor area or a quieter one.

In this problem, we would only take only indoor audio files and predict the area ('Euston', 'westend', 'kensington', 'campus', 'british', 'southbank') 
where a sample audio file was recorded.

Models implemented: KNN, Logistic Regression

Techniques: Data cleaning, feature selection, outlier detection, class balancing and optimal model parameter selection using GridSearch
